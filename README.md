I'm currently a 2nd Year PhD Candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology 🐝 studying
- 🧮 Operations Research for Convex optimization theory and algorithms. I am interested in the theory, complexity analysis, and implementation of efficiently computable algorithms and numerical codes for solving large-scale optimization problems.
- I'm grateful to be advised by [Anton J. Kleywegt](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/anton-kleywegt/) and [Renato D.C. Monteiro](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/renato-monteiro/), alongside being fortunate to collaborate and learn from [Arkadi Nemirovski](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/CVBrief.htm).

Previously, I also pursued
- B.S. in Economics & Mathematics
- M.S. in Economics & Mathematics
